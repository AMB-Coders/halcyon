  teaser: "Gold was a small IBM Power5 system consisting of one front-end node and one compute node. The compute node was a Dual-Processor 1.5 GHz Dual-Core Power5 520 with 8 GB of RAM. This system was designed to be used only by users with legacy IBM architecture-optimized or AIX-specific code. Gold was intended to help facilitate the porting of any code designed for the IBM SP system at Purdue, which was retired in 2008."
