  teaser: "Brown is a Community Cluster optimized for communities running traditional, tightly-coupled science and engineering applications. Brown was built through a partnership with Dell and Intel in October 2017. Brown consists of Dell compute nodes with two 12-core Intel Xeon Gold \"Sky Lake\" processors (24 cores per node) and 96 GB of memory. All nodes have 100 Gbps EDR Infiniband interconnect and a 5-year warranty."
