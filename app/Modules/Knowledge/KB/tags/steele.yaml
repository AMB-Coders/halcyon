  teaser: "Steele was a compute cluster operated by ITaP and the first system built under Purdue's Community Cluster Program. ITaP installed Steele in May 2008 in an unprecedented single-day installation. It replaced and expanded upon ITaP research resources retired at the same time, including the Hamlet, Lear, and Macbeth clusters. Steele consisted of 852 64-bit, 8-core Dell 1950 and 9 64-bit, 8-core Dell 2950 systems with various combinations of 16-32 GB RAM, 160 GB to 2 TB of disk, and 1 Gigabit Ethernet (1GigE) and InfiniBand local to each node."
