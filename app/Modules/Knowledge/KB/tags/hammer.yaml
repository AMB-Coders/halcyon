  teaser: "Hammer is optimized for Purdue's communities utilizing loosely-coupled, high-throughput computing. Hammer was initially built through a partnership with HP and Intel in April 2015. Hammer was expanded again in late 2016. Hammer will be expanded annually, with each year's purchase of nodes to remain in production for 5 years from their initial purchase."
