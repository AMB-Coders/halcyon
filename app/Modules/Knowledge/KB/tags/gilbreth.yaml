  teaser: "Gilbreth is a new type of addition to Purdue's Community Clusters, designed specifically for applications which are able to take advantage of GPU accelerators. While applications must be specially-crafted to use GPUs, a GPU-enabled application can often run many times faster than the same application could on general-purpose CPUs. Due to the increased cost of GPU-equipped nodes, Gilbreth is being offered with some new purchase options to allow for shared access at a lower price point than the full cost of a node."
