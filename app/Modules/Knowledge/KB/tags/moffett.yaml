  teaser: "Moffett was a SiCortex 5832 system. It consisted of 28 modules, each containing 27 six-processor SMP nodes for a total of 4536 processor cores. The SiCortex design was highly unusual; it paired relatively slow individual processor cores (633 MHz) with an extraordinarily fast custom interconnect fabric, and provided these in very large numbers. In addition, the SiCortex design used very little power and thereby generated very little heat."
