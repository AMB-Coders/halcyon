  teaser: "Rice is optimized for Purdue's communities running traditional, tightly-coupled science and engineering applications. Rice was built through a partnership with HP and Intel in April 2015. Rice consists of HP compute nodes with two 10-core Intel Xeon-E5 processors (20 cores per node) and 64 GB of memory. All nodes have 56 Gbps FDR Infiniband interconnect and a 5-year warranty."
