  teaser: "Caesar was an SGI Altix 4700 system. This large memory SMP design featured 128 processors and 512 GB of RAM connected via SGI's high-bandwidth, low-latency NUMAlink shared-memory interface. The extremely large amount of shared memory in this system made it ideal for jobs where many processors must all share a large amount of in-memory data, and for large parallel jobs, using shared memory for fast communication between processors."
