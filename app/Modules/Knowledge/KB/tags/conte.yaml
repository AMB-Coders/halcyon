  teaser: "Conte was built through a partnership with HP and Intel in June 2013, and was the largest of Purdue's flagship community clusters. Conte consisted of HP compute nodes with two 8-core Intel Xeon-E5 processors (16 cores per node) and 64 GB of memory. Each node was also equipped with two 60-core Xeon Phi coprocessors. All nodes had 40 Gbps FDR10 Infiniband connections and a 5-year warranty. Conte was decommissioned on August 1, 2018."
