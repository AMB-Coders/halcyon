# Overview of ${resource.name}
REED was an acronym for "Research Ecosystem for Encumbered Data".  REED GovCloud was designed for use with data whose handling required compliance with various security protocols, beyond those generally used within an open academic setting. It was subsequently retired in May 2020 and replaced by Weber.

REED GovCloud was implemented within Amazon's GovCloud service, and had access portals and control points positioned within Purdue's Research Computing Infrastructure.

Former REED GovCloud resources used Microsoft Windows Server, accessed through Remote Desktop protocols, and backed with an expandable pool of AWS compute nodes.
