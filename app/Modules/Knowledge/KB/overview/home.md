# ${resource.name} Overview

Your ${resource.name} for all ITaP research resources is provided by a DDN GS7KX filesystem appliance.
        
<kbd>/home</kbd> is the primary space used to permanently hold files for a given user. This space has a quota which can be monitored at any time by using a <kbd>myquota</kbd> command.

${resource.name} spaces currently reside on a self-contained GPFS storage system that provides redundant, high-availability disk space and is a central component of ITaP's research systems infrastructure.

ITaP uses network attached storage (NAS) appliances from DDN to provide scale-out ${resource.name} space to cluster systems. This storage is reliable, backed-up (via snapshots), and is globally available on all ITaP research systems.  Your ${resource.name} is medium-performance, non-purged space suitable for tasks like sharing data, editing files, developing and building software, and many other uses.

<strong>Your ${resource.name} is not designed or intended for use as high-performance working space for running jobs.</strong>
