# Overview of ${resource.name}

Gold was a small IBM Power5 system consisting of one front-end node and one compute node. The compute node was a Dual-Processor 1.5 GHz Dual-Core Power5 520 with 8 GB of RAM. This system was designed to be used only by users with legacy IBM architecture-optimized or AIX-specific code. Gold was intended to help facilitate the porting of any code designed for the IBM SP system at Purdue, which was retired in 2008.

Gold ran AIX 5.3 and used PBSPro 9.x for resource and job management.
