# ${resource.name} Overview

ITaP Research Computing offered shared research group storage available from all research clusters or directly usable from labs at a competitive price. It was retired in 2014.

ITaP served  ${resource.name} from EMC Isilon network attached storage (NAS) servers with a total capacity of 3 PB.  This storage was redundant and reliable, featured nightly snapshots for the last week, and was globally available on all ITaP research systems.  ${resource.name} was medium-performance, non-purged space suitable for tasks such as sharing data, editing files, developing and building software, and many other uses.
