# Managing Users

All users of your GitHub repositories will need to have an ITaP Research Computing account and Purdue Career Account. You may manage this access through the the [self-service user management tool](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/account/user/). Users should be added to your "base" Unix group. This is the first Unix group listed in the tool, typically it is named after you or your lab, and is the group with no suffixes. If this person already had an ITaP Research Computing account, they will be able to log in immediately, you will be able to start assigning them to repositories immediately, and will be automatically associated with your organization within an hour. If they did not have an account, one will be created overnight. They will appear in GitHub and be able to log in the following morning.
