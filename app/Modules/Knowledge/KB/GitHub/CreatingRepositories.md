# Creating repositories

You may create repositories to share within your organization, or create personal repositories. Head to the [GitHub instance](https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/) and click the New Repository button. Choose your organization or your username and give it a name. Select either Public or Private access for your repository. Public repositories are visible to anyone on the Internet. Private repositories are only visible to those you choose. In either, only those you choose are able to modify the repository. **NOTE**: commit privileges and private repository viewing access requires a Purdue Career Account and ITaP Research Computing account.
