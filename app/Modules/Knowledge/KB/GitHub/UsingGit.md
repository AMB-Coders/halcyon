GitHub provides an [excellent guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on the basics of using Git and Github. Guides are also [available on other topics](https://guides.github.com/). All of these guides are applicable to our instance, except you will use <https://github.rcac.purdue.edu> as the URL instead of <https://github.com>.
