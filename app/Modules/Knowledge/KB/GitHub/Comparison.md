# ITaP Research Computing Github vs github.com

The [GitHub Enterprise instance](https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/) is a licensed product offering from GitHub itself. It is an instance of the GitHub product on github.com, and is completely independent. The system is controlled and hosted by ITaP and uses Purdue Career Accounts for access control. It provides the full functionality of paid memberships with github.com, at no cost to Purdue researchers.
