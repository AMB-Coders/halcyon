# Getting started

The GitHub instance is offered at no cost to Purdue research groups, current students and faculty, or any Purdue person preforming academic not-for-profit research. Anyone else wanting to use the GitHub instance (such as Purdue staff for adminstrative purposes) should <a href="mailto:rcac-help@purdue.edu">contact us</a> to discuss the options. To get started with GitHub head to the [ordering page](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/order/products/27) to request access. Once you have an organization, you may begin to set up repositories and teams of collaborators.

# Staff notes
Please have users submit request through the ordering page. Users are not able to create orgs on their own and please *do not* create orgs for them yourself manually. We need the orders for tracking who is using it for licensing purposes and because organizations and users share a namespace we have to very carefully name organizations.
