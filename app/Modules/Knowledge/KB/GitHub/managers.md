# Promoting and Demoting Managers/Owners

GitHub organizations each have one or more managers, or owners. Owners of an organization have more permissions within that organization than regular members. [Compare permission levels](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.8/user/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization/) to determine which is best for all members of your research group.

Any exisiting member of an organization can be promoted to Owner status by an existing Owner. Users will need to be a [member of the organization](../ManagingUsers) before they can be promoted.

To promote an existing Organization member:

* Navigate to [github.rcac.purdue.edu](https://github.rcac.purdue.edu)
* From the dropdown (typically defaults to your username), select your Organization
* Click the "View Organization" button in the upper right
* Alternatively, navigate directly to github.rcac.purdue.edu/yourorganization
* Select the People tab (next to Repositories)
* Find the member to be promoted, and select Owner from the dropdown now labeled "Member"

To demote an existing Organization owner:

* Repeat steps above, except change Owner dropdown to Member

{::if user.staff == 1}

# Staff Notes

To promote/demote someone to a manager of an organization at the request of a faculty, you have to make the change as the faculty:

* Navigate to [github.rcac.purdue.edu](https://github.rcac.purdue.edu)
* Click the "rocket ship" icon in the far upper right
* In the "search users" box, search the username of an existing owner of the organization.
* Click the "Admin" button (with the gears) near the top center of the page
* From the big red box, click "Sign into GitHub as user"
* Type in a reason for accessing as the user
* Follow steps at the top as if you were the faculty
