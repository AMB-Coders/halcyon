# Rename GitHub Organization

If requested by the user, an organization in GitHub can be renamed. To rename an organization called ORGNAME follow these steps:

***NOTE: GitHub organization names MUST be greater than 8 characters!!*** Organizations share namespace with usernames, and if we create an org with <= 8 character length we run the risk of a collision in the future (or already have a conflict).

1) From the [account page](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/account/group/) search for the group in the selector tab, and click the edit button next to the GitHub organization name. Edit the field to reflect the new desired name.

2) Log into [github.rcac.purdue.edu](https://github.rcac.purdue.edu)

3) Navigate to the Organization: https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/ORGNAME.

4) Click the rocketship in the upper right hand corner.

5) Select 'Admin' on the left hand column.

6) Type the new desired name in the Rename Account box and confirm. ***See note above about name requirements!***
