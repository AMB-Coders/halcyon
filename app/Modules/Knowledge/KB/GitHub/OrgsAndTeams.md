# Organization and Teams

Essentially, an organization is a place to house your research group's work. Multiple repositories may be created inside the organization. You may create teams, or lists of users, for each project. You can then assign the team to a repository, and give the team appropriate permissions to the repository. Organizations and teams are [further described by GitHub](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations).

See our [getting started](../GettingStarted) page for more details on setting up an organization.
