# Regular Maintenance

Regular planned maintenance on ITaP Research Computing GitHub is scheduled for the first Wednesday of every month, 3:00pm to 5:00pm.  During this time, the server will undergo maintenance tasks that can not be completed with the server in production.

Operations requiring connection to the central server (e.g. new check-outs or pull requests, etc) may time out during the maintenance period. Operations with your own local repository will not be affected.
