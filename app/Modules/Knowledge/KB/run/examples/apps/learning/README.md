We support several Machine Learning (ML) applications on ITaP community clusters. The collection of these packages are referred to as <kbd>ML-Toolkit</kbd> throughout this documentation. Currently, following 9 applications are included in ML-Toolkit.
<pre>
caffe			cntk			gym
keras			opencv			pytorch
tensorflow		tflearn			theano
</pre>

Note that managing Python dependencies of ML applications is non-trivial, therefore, we recommend that you read the documentations carefully before embarking on a journey to build intelligent machines.
