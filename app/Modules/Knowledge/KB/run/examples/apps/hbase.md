# HBase

<a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">Apache HBase</a> is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store. HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html">Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data</a> by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.
