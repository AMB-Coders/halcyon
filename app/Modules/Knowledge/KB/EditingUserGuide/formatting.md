# Formatting Text

Text formatting is accomplished using Markdown syntax. All standard Markdown syntax is valid - as well, plain HTML is also supported.

Most existing articles were imported using plain HTML. New article and edits should be done in Markdown, and old articles converted from HTML to Markdown as they are touched.

Details of Markdown will not be covered here, but there is plenty of documentation available online as this is a standard formatting syntax:
