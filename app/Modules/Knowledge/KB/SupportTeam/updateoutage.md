# Updating Outages

Once an outage is posted you may need to post and send an update to the outage.

**1)** Either search for the article in the [Search and Manage News](/news/manage/) page or find the article on the homepage, go to the article, and click the 'Edit News' link at the bottom of the page. Be sure you are still logged into the site.

**2)** At the bottom of the page, you should see a 'Post an update' text box with a drop down above it. Select an update template from the drop down. To extend an outage use the "Update - Extend Outage" template. 

**3)** Replace the "%%placeholder%%" text as appropriate. Fill in a brief description of the root cause if more details have come to light. This should be brief or left off if there is no new information. In-depth explainations are not necessary, but users generally appreciate not being left in the dark with a generic "the problem". The %updatetime% will automatically fill in with the time you save the update. Do not replace with your own text. DO NOT add any "UPDATE: " type text in the update. These will be automatically added and formatted consistently.

**4)** Click the save icon to save the update.

**5)** Double check the update looks correct, and click the 'Mail Preview' icon. Preview the update, and click the 'Send Mail' button. The button looks like this (the above test example does not show it because it is not published):
