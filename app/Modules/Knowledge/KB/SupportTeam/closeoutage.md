# Closing Outages

Once an outage is resolved and RTS has happened you will need to post and send an update to the close outage.

**1)** Either search for the article in the [Search and Manage News](/news/manage/) page or find the article on the homepage, go to the article, and click the 'Edit News' link at the bottom of the page. Be sure you are still logged into the site.

**2)** At the bottom of the page, you should see a 'Post an update' text box with a drop down above it. Select an update template from the drop down. To close an outage use the "Update - Cluster Outage RTS" template.

**3)** If you need to add information relevant to the outage, add to the text as appropriate, otherwise leave as is. The %updatetime% will automatically fill in with the time you save the update. Do not replace with your own text. DO NOT add any "UPDATE: " type text in the update. These will be automatically added and formatted consistently.

**4)** Click the save icon to save the update.

**5)** Set the end time on the news posting or it will show up on the main page forever. Click the calendar icon next to the date to bring up the edit menu, and set an appropriate end time from the date/time picker. This does not necessarily need to match the update time exactly. The article will continue showing on the home page for 12 hours.

**6)** Double check the update looks correct, and click the 'Mail Preview' icon. Preview the update, and click the 'Send Mail' button. The button looks like this (the above test example does not show it because it is not published):
