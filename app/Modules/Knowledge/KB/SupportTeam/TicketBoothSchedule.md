# Ticket Booth Schedule

All Support Team members take turns triaging incoming tickets.  This is rotated on a daily basis at 5:00pm.  Weekends and holidays, unless otherwise noted, are the responsibility of the person who has the next working day (though need not be dealt with until then).  Anyone on the schedule is welcome to trade with anyone else if needed.  Contact Kevin if you have an emergency and cannot arrange coverage.

**[View current version of schedule on GitHub](https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/RCAC-Staff/www/blob/master/knowledge/KB/SupportTeam/TicketBoothSchedule.md)**. Schedule may have been updated but not pushed out to website.
