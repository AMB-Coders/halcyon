### Question                                                                           
How can I get access to Sentaurus tools for micro- and nano-electronics design?

### Answer
Sentaurus software license requires a signed NDA. Please contact 
[Dr. Mark Johnson, Director of ECE Instructional Laboratories](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mcjohnso/) to complete the process.

Once the licensing process is complete and you have been added into a <code>cae2</code> Unix group, you could use Sentaurus on RCAC community clusters by loading the corresponding environment module: 
<pre><code>module load sentaurus</code></pre>
{::else}
Sentaurus is not currently available on ${resource.name}.  Please contact our support team at rcac-help@purdue.edu if you would like it to be installed for your project.
