### How do ${resource.name}, Fortress, and PURR relate to each other?

The ${resource.name}, Fortress, and PURR, are complementary parts of Purdue's infrastructure for working with research data. The ${resource.name} is designed for large, actively-used, persistent research data; Fortress is intended for long-term, archival storage of data and results; and PURR is for managment, curation, and long-term preservation of research data.
