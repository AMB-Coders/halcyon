### What do I need to do before I access my REED Folder?

* Anyone with access to data in scope of HIPAA must complete the required [HIPAA training](https://www.purdue.edu/legalcounsel/HIPAA/Training.html) annually. A PI is  responsible to ensure the training is completed annually.
* Ensure youâ€™re using [BoilerKey](https://www.purdue.edu/securepurdue/iamoServices/BoilerKey.html)
* For limited data sets, a Data Security Plan and Data Use Agreement will be required. This process should be started by [Sponsored Program Services](https://www.purdue.edu/business/sps/)
* Ensure you understand the following [policies and procedures](https://www.purdue.edu/legalcounsel/HIPAA/FormsProcedures.html) specific to HIPAA.
* If you are working with the [IRB](https://www.irb.purdue.edu/), ensure the process is completed prior to requesting access to REED Folder.
