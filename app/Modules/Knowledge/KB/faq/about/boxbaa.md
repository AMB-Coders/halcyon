### Does Purdue have a Business Associate Agreement with Box?

Box supports the HIPAA and HITECH regulations, as well as the ability to sign HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with customers. Customers who are required by law to comply with HIPAA, such as HIPAA Covered Entities and HIPAA Business Associates, must have an Enterprise or Elite account with Box and sign a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA).
* Purdue University signed a Business Associate Agreement with Box, and Box accounts are Enterprise.
* Box provides the ability to use O365 online office application to open and work with content. Purdue University has signed a Business Associate Agreement with Microsoft.
* All other third-party service providers with our instance of Box Enterprise are not covered by a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

Do not use third party party applications to process data considered Restricted via your Purdue managed Box account. Purdue University does not maintain a contractual agreement with the vendor, and the required security controls are not in place.

A Box Managed account is your Purdue managed Box account. A REED folder is a project folder created in secure folder structure within Box.
