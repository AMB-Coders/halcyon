### Question                                                                           
Can I get a private (virtual or physical) server from RCAC?

### Answer
Often, researchers may want a private server to run databases, web servers, or other software.
RCAC currently does not offer private servers (formerly known as "Firebox").

For use cases like this, we recommend the Jetstream Cloud (http://jetstream-cloud.org/) 
an NSF-funded science cloud  allocated through the XSEDE project. 
RCAC staff can help get you access to Jetstream to test, or to help write an allocation 
proposal for larger projects.

Alternatively, you may consider commercial cloud providers such as Amazon 
Web Services, Azure, or Digital Ocean. These services are very flexible, but do come with 
a monetary cost.
