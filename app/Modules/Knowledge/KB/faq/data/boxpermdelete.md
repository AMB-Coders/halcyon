### Can I delete my files permanently from Box?

Individuals can delete a file or folder, and the item will be placed in the Trash. Individuals will not be able to permanently delete the items. An automated process is in place to remove data older than 90 days. Once the item is purged, it can't be recovered using the built in Box tools.
