### What is the best way to access my data?

[HSI](../../../storage/transfer/hsi) and [HTAR](../../../storage/transfer/htar): HSI provides a FTP-style interface taking advantage of the power of HPSS without requiring any special user knowledge. HTAR is a utility to aggregate a set of files into a single tar archive directly into Fortress, without requiring space to first create an archive.
