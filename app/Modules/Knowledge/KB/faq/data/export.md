### Can I store Export-controlled data on ${resource.name}?

The ${resource.name} is not approved for storing data requiring Export control including ITAR, FISMA, DFAR-7012, NIST 800-171. 
Please contact the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/research/research-compliance/export-control/">Export Control Office</a> to discuss technology control plans and data storage appropriate for export controlled projects.
