### Can I use Unmanaged Box accounts, and other Cloud Storage Options?

Unmanaged  (free and commercial) Box accounts and all other Cloud Storage options are not approved for storing or sharing sensitive or restricted data. Purdue University does not maintain a contractual agreement with the vendor, and the required security controls are not in place. Personal use of cloud storage can continue, however sensitive and restricted data must not be stored in the account. The table below will help you determine where to store your data.
