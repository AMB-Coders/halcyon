### Can I integrate 3rd-Party Apps with my Box folder?

Third-Party Apps for Box

While official Box add-on applications are approved for use with Purdue Box.com folders, third-party apps have not been reviewed for impact to security and are not approved for use until a security review has been completed by IT Security and Policy. If the official Box apps cannot provide the functionality you need, you may request a security review of the third-party app you are considering by submitting an email including the app name and the functionality you are addressing with the app to itpolicyreq@purdue.edu.
