### Can I set up a shared space for my research group to share data?

Research groups are assigned a group data storage space within Fortress with each Data Depot group space. Faculty should <a href="/storage/depot">request a Data Depot trial</a> to create a shared Fortress space for their research group.

<strong>ITaP research resources are not intended to store data protected by Federal privacy and security laws (e.g., HIPAA, ITAR, classified, etc.).  It is the responsibility of the faculty partner to ensure that no protected data is stored on the systems.</strong>

Please keep in mind that such spaces are, by design, accessible by others and should not be used to store private information such as grades, login credentials, or personal data. Contact us at <a href="mailto:rcac-help@purdue.edu">rcac-help@purdue.edu</a> to create a group space for your group.
