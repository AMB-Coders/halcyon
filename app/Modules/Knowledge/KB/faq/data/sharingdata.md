### Can I share data with outside collaborators?
{::if resource.name != Weber}
Yes! Globus allows convenient sharing of data with outside collaborators. Data can be shared with collaborators' personal computers or directly with many other computing resources at other intstitutions. See the Globus documentation on how to share data:

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/share-files/">https://docs.globus.org/how-to/share-files/</a>
</ul>
{::else}
No, external collaboration is not allowed for ${resource.name}.
