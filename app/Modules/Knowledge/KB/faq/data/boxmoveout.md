### Should I move restricted data to other folders outside of a REED Folder?

When storing data within scope of HIPAA, if must be stored in a REED Folder:
* Do not move and or store the data in a folder hosted directly in your personal Box account.
* Do not store the data outside of REED Folder unless you moving the data to a HIPAA aligned system and you have received approval from Purdue's IT Security and Policy group (ITSP). 
* Moving data may also require approval from campus offices and committees responsible for contractual compliance and research regulatory affairs.
