### Can I use File Level Encryption with a REED Folder?

The data stored in REED folder is encrypted at rest, however file level encryption is a responsibility of the individual. Files can be encrypted prior to upload for added security measures. Do not use Windows EFS, the data will be uploaded without the encryption. Currently, we recommend using VeraCrypt.
