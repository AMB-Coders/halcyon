### What is a Limited Data Set?

A limited data set is a separate legal concept under the privacy rule and is considered identifiable data. Specifically, a limited data set refers to PHI that has had the following 16 unique identifiers removed. A data use agreement is how covered entities obtain satisfactory assurances that the recipient of the limited data set will use or disclose the PHI in the data set only for specified purposes. A Data Use Agreement will continue to be required when working with limited data sets in Box.
