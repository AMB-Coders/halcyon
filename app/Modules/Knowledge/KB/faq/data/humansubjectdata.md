### What do I need to do in order to store non-HIPAA human subjects data in the ${resource.name}?

Use the following IRB-approved text in your IRB documentation when describing your data safeguards, substituting the PI's name for "PROFESSORNAME":

<em>Only individuals specifically approved by PROFESSORNAME may access project data in the Research ${resource.name}.  All membership in the PROFESSORNAME group is authorized by the project PI(s) and/or designees. Purdue University has network firewalls and other security devices to protect the Research ${resource.name} infrastructure from outside the campus.

Purdue Career accounts have password security policies that enforce age and quality requirements.

Auditing is enabled on Research ${resource.name} fileservers to track login attempts, maintain logs, and generate reports of access attempts.</em>
