### How should I monitor access to my REED Folder?

The PI or Project Ownerâ€™s should follow the recommendations below:
* Review Sharing tab monthly, to ensure only authorized people have access to the data
* Review the Access Stats on files deemed restricted periodically to ensure the actions taken are appropriate.
* Maintain a log of your actions, the log can be a spreadsheet or word document. The log should be stored outside of Box.
