### Access
Accounts on REED are set up and configured completely separately from other RCAC resources. In order to gain access to REED, please contact Kevin Colby (colbykd@purdue.edu) to discuss your project's needs.

### VPN
In addition to login credentials for REED itself, you will need access to a restricted Virtual Private Network (VPN) in order to connect to the REED server. Login to the VPN is through BoilerKey, using two-factor authentication.

### BoilerKey
Information about BoilerKey can be found  <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/apps/account/IAMO/BoilerKeyNew/Purdue_CareerAccount_BoilerKey_FAQ.jsp"> Here </a>  and a self-serve page to request a BoilerKey is <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/apps/account/BoilerKeySelfServe"> Here </a>

You can choose to request either a physical keyfob device or a smartphone app for your BoilerKey access. In either case, you will need to use your BoilerKey each time you want to connect your workstation to the VPN.
