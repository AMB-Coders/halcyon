# Passwords

If you have received a default password as part of the process of obtaining your account, you should change it before you log onto ${resource.name} for the first time. Change your password from the SecurePurdue website. You will have the same password on all ITaP systems such as ${resource.name}, Purdue email, or Blackboard.

Passwords may need to be changed periodically in accordance with Purdue security policies. Passwords must follow certain guidelines as described on the SecurePurdue webpage and ITaP recommends following some guidelines to select a strong password.

***ITaP staff will NEVER ask for your password, by email or otherwise.***

***Never share your password with another user or make your password known to anyone else.***
