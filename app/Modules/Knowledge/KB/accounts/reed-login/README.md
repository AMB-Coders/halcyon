## Windows:

### VPN

* Your login is your Purdue Career Account ID
* Your password is generated at each login with the [BoilerKey](https://www.purdue.edu/apps/account/IAMO/BoilerKeyNew/Purdue_CareerAccount_BoilerKey.jsp).

- Download and install the CISCO VPN client from [Purdue WebVPN](https://webvpn.purdue.edu)
- Using the client, connect to the VPN at `reedvpn.itap.purdue.edu`.

### Remote Desktop

* Your login and password are not your career account credentials.  They will be provided to you when you are approved for access to REED.
* Once you are connected to the VPN use Windows Remote Desktop to connect to your Project's server.  

* Your Remote Desktop server will be named with the lower case name of your project, followed by `-wts01.reed.rcac.purdue.edu`

For instance, if your project name is `Proj-1`, you would connect to its Desktop Server at:
`proj-1-wts01.reed.rcac.purdue.edu`

## Linux / Mac:

Login follows the same process as for Windows.  
* The ['OpenConnect' VPN client](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/) can be used to connect to the VPN, and any Windows-compatible Remote Desktop client can then be used to connect to your project's Remote Desktop server.

* Mac users can download a Remote Desktop client from [Remote Desktop for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12).
