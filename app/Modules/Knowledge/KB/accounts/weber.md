### VPN
In addition to login credentials for ${resource.name} itself, you will need access to a restricted Virtual Private Network (VPN) in order to connect to ${resource.name}. Login to the VPN is through BoilerKey, using two-factor authentication.

### BoilerKey
Information about BoilerKey can be found  <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/apps/account/IAMO/BoilerKeyNew/Purdue_CareerAccount_BoilerKey_FAQ.jsp"> here </a>  and a self-serve page to request a BoilerKey is <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/apps/account/BoilerKeySelfServe"> here </a>

You can choose to request either a physical keyfob device or a smartphone app for your BoilerKey access. In either case, you will need to use your BoilerKey each time you want to connect your workstation to the VPN.
