# Purchasing Nodes - Community Cluster Program

Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP) operates a significant shared cluster computing infrastructure developed over several years through focused acquisitions using funds from grants, faculty startup packages, and institutional sources.  These "community clusters" are now at the foundation of Purdue's research cyberinfrastructure.

**We strongly encourage any Purdue faculty or staff with computational needs to join this growing community and enjoy the enormous benefits this shared infrastructure provides:**

* **Peace of Mind**
* 
 ITaP system administrators take care of security patches, attempted hacks, operating system upgrades, and hardware repair so faculty and graduate students can concentrate on research.
* **Low Overhead**
* 
 ITaP data centers provide infrastructure such as networking, racks, floor space, cooling, and power.
* **Cost Effective**
* 
 ITaP works with vendors to obtain the best price for computing resources by pooling funds from different disciplines to leverage greater group purchasing power.

Through the Community Cluster Program, Purdue affiliates have invested several million dollars in computational and storage resources from Q4 2006 to the present with great success in both the research accomplished and the money saved on equipment purchases.
