# Access to ${resource.name}

### Obtaining an Account

All Purdue faculty, staff, and students have a Box.com account for personal files.

Research projects requiring regulated storage are assigned group data storage space within ${resource.name}. Project PIs may authorize additional users to collaborate within the folder.

Box research lab Folders <strong>are not</strong> intended to store data protected by Federal privacy and security laws. REED Folders are designed to align with the NIST SP 800-171 standard, and are approved for storing L3 projects requiring HIPAA-aligned storage. Compliance with additional regulations such as CUI, ITAR, EAR, or FERPA are under review.

Neither Purdue or Box set any limits on the total amount or number of files that you may store within your ${resource.name}. However, there are several restrictions on the nature of files you may store:

* Any one individual file may be no larger than 15 GB.

### Outside Collaborators

Within the bounds of your data use agreements, IRB protocols, or technology control plans, REED data folders may be shared with Purdue or non-Purdue collaborators.

### Login to Box to Access your Research Lab Folder

Access to your ${resource.name} is done using your Purdue Career Account by visiting <a href="https://purdue.box.com">purdue.box.com</a>.
