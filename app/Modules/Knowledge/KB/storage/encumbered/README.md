# PLEASE NOTE:

REED is a secure resource, whose operation is controlled by Federal Regulations

You are responsible for maintaining the integrity of your Project's resources, including responsibility for any files you bring in to the controlled environment, and you are responsible for knowing and adhering to standards applicable to file transfer out of the environment.

* ### DO NOT bring unsafe files into the REED environment.
* ### DO NOT release sensitive information outside REED. 

### REED Environment

Within REED, you will have several Windows drives accessible to you.  (see 'Drive mapping' link below)
There is a drive mapping for incoming files, but there is no drive mapped for outgoing files.  Any files to be taken out of REED must go through an audited process, requiring permission of at least two team members.

Project Home folders will be private, but all other material within a Project will be readable by all Project members.
