### Overview:

With your files in the `out_approved` directory of your Project's outgoing file server, you can log into that file server from an external source to retrieve the ZIP archive containing the files.

### Connect

* Login to the REED VPN
* Use any SCP file transfer client to connect to the external name of your project's outgoing file server.
* Login with your REED credentials
* Get files from your `out_approved` directory.

Files will be automatically deleted from the `out_approved` directory after 3 days.
