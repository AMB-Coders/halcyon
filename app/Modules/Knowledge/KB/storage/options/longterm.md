# Long-Term Storage

<em>Long-term Storage</em> or <em>Permanent Storage</em> is available to ITaP research users on the High Performance Storage System (HPSS), an archival storage system, called <strong>Fortress</strong>.   Program files, data files and any other files which are <strong>not used often</strong>, but which must be saved, can be put in permanent storage.  Fortress currently has over 10PB of capacity.

# Archive "Cold Storage"

Storage for <strong>completed</strong>, <strong>inactive</strong>, or <strong>retired</strong> projects is available via Archive.  Data stored in Archive must be stored in a compressed format.  Once data is stored in Archive, it can only be retrieved by contacting Export Control to request access.  Access may be granted for report generation, thesis/dissertation development, etc.  However, once data is stored in Archive, it cannot be modified in any way.
