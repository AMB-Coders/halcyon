# Storage Options

{::if resource.name != Weber}
File storage options on ITaP research systems include long-term storage (home directories, Fortress) and short-term storage (scratch directories, /tmp directory). Each option has different performance and intended uses, and some options vary from system to system as well. ITaP provides daily snapshots of home directories for a limited time for accidental deletion recovery. ITaP does not back up scratch directories or temporary storage and regularly purges old files from scratch and /tmp directories. More details about each storage option appear below.
