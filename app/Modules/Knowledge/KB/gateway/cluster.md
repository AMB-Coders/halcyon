# Cluster Tools

The Cluster Tools menu contains cluster utilities. At the moment, only a terminal app is provided. Additional apps may be developed and provided in the future.

# Shell Access

Launching the shell app will provide you with a web-based terminal session on the cluster front-end. This is equivalent to using a standalone SSH client to connect to `${resource.frontend}.rcac.purdue.edu` where you are connected to one several front-ends. The normal acceptable [front-end use policy](/policies/frontenduse/) applies to access through the web-app. X11 Forwarding is not supported. Use of one of the [interactive apps](../interactive) is recommended for graphical applications.
