# Jupyter Notebook 

The Notebook app will launch a Notebook session on a compute node and allow you to connect directly to it in a web browser.

To launch a Notebook session on a compute node, select the Notebook app. From the submit form, select from the available options - the queue to which you wish to submit, and the number of wallclock hours you wish to have job running. There is also a checkbox that enable a notification to your email when the job starts.

After the interactive job is submitted you will be taken to your list of active interactive app sessions. You can monitor the status of the job from here until it starts, or if you enabled the email notification, watch your Purdue email for the notification the job has started.

Once it is indicated the job has started you can connect to the desktop with the "Connect to Jupyter" button. Once connected, you can create new notebooks, selecting the currently available Anaconda versions available as modules, and any personally created Notebook kernels.

The session will be terminated after the wallclock hours you specified have elapsed or you terminate the session early with the "Delete" button from the list of sessions. Deleting the session when you are finished will free up queue resources for your labmates and other users on the system.
