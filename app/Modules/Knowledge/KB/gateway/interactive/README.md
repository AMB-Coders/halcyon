# Interactive Apps

There are several interactive apps available through Gateway that can be accessed through the Interactive Apps dropdown menu. These apps are provided with a basic node and software configuration as a 'quick-launch' option to get your work up and running quickly. For simplicity, minimal options are provided - these apps are not intended for complex configuration/customization scenarios.

After you a submit an interactive app to the queue, Gateway will track and manage the session. Once it starts, you may connect and disconnect from the session in your browser, leaving the job running while you log out of your browser.

Each of the available apps are documented through the following links.
